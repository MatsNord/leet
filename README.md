## Note
This is part of an assignment I got. My intention was, and still is to build the UI in React.
For now it is JQuery in the UI, as I needed to get something up en running really quickly

## Build
There is no requirements for building this app

## Test
There are few tests added
`npm test`

## Run
`npm start`

Point the browser to http://localhost:3000
